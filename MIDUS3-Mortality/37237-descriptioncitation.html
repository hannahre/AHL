		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>In 1995-1996, the MacArthur Midlife Research Network carried out a national survey of over 7,000 Americans aged 25 to 74 [<a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/2760">ICPSR 2760</a>]. The purpose of the study was to investigate the role of behavioral, psychological, and social factors in understanding age-related differences in physical and mental health.</p>
<p>With support from the National Institute on Aging, an initial follow-up of the original Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) samples was conducted in 2004 (MIDUS 2). The daily stress and cognitive functioning projects were repeated at MIDUS 2; in addition the protocol was expanded to include biomarkers and neuroscience. In 2005, a baseline sample of 592 African Americans from Milwaukee was added to MIDUS to examine health issues in minority populations.</p>
<p>In 2013 a third wave (MIDUS 3) of survey data was collected on longitudinal participants. Data collection for this follow-up wave largely repeated baseline assessments (e.g., phone interview and extensive self-administered questionnaire), with additional questions in selected areas (e.g., economic recession experiences, optimism and coping, stressful life events, and caregiving). A third wave of cognitive functioning data and a second wave of the Milwaukee sample were also collected. Data collection for the daily diary, biomarkers, and neuroscience is ongoing. This dataset includes all known MIDUS decedents (N=1,382) from the Core National and Milwaukee samples as of November 2017.</p></span></p>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> The primary purpose of this study was to obtain information about the underlying cause of death for Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) and Milwaukee decedents.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> 1382 prior participants in the MIDUS series with a confirmed decedent status.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Time Method:</strong> Longitudinal</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> All decedent participants of the MIDUS series.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> Individual</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Method of Data Collection:</strong> administrative records data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> record abstracts</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Description of Variables:</strong> <p>The data set contains 11 variables and 1,382 cases. The variables include decedent status, source of decedent information, month and year of death, and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes.</p>
<p>The demographic variable, gender, is also included.</p></span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Version History:</strong> <p>2019-03-21 ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>
