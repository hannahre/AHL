       temp <- data.frame(Item = rep(names(quest_out[i]), nrow(quest_out[[i]])),
                      Category = row.names(quest_out[[i]]),
                      quest_out[[i]])

      freqs$Item <- factor(freqs$Item, levels = unique(freqs$Item))
   freqs
}
freqout <- freq_dframer(acams)
freqout
```
## Visualization of frequencies
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Relative frequencies 
ggplot(freqout, aes(x = Category, y = Frequency)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(. ~ Item, nrow = 5 )
```
# Number of CAM treatments used in the past 12 months 
```{r, echo = FALSE}

# Convert column to a factor 
totalCams <- as.factor(totalCams)

# Relative frequencies 
prop.table(table(totalCams))

# Counts and percentages, relative and cumulative 
tb <- fdt_cat(totalCams)
tb

# create a histogram of total CAMs used 
hist(as.numeric(totalCams))
```

# Correlation matrix 
Create and plot the tetrachoric correlation matrix for all CAMs. 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Create correlation matrix 
het.mat <- hetcor(acams)$cor
cor.plot(het.mat, numbers=T, upper=FALSE, main = "Tetrachoric Correlations", show.legend = TRUE, xlas = 2)
```

Check that items are not perfectly correlated with each other. 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# EFA following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5RJvMaHJNo&ab_channel=StatisticsofDOOM
# Channel: Statistics of DOOM by Lecturer: Dr. Erin M. Buchanan

# Screen data 
# nrow(acams)
# n = 5326

# Check min and max scores by running summary 
# summary(acams)

# Additivity - make sure nothing is correlated at 1. 
# don't want any 1s on the off diagonal.
symnum(het.mat)
```
# Test for correlation adequacy 
I will test for correlation adequacy using Bartlett's Sphericity test. This test tests the hypothesis that correlations between variables are greater than would be expected by chance. The null hypothesis states that all off diagonal are 0. If the null hypothesis is rejected there is correlation adequacy. 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Correlation adequacy Bartlett's test
cortest.bartlett(het.mat, n = nrow(acams))
```
I reject the null hypothesis. The CAM items are adequately correlated. 

# Test for sampling adequacy 
I will test for sampling adequacy using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test.MSA refers to the overall measure of sampling adequacy. MSAi refer to the measure of sampling adequacy for each item. MSA is a measure of the proportion of variance among variables that might be common variance. The lower the proportion of variance that is common the more suited the data are for factor analysis.  

MSA cutoffs: >.9 marvelous, .8s meritorious, .7s middling, .6s mediocre, .5s miserable, less than .5 is unacceptable.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
KMO(het.mat)
```
Items that may be a concern with regard to sampling adequacy: prayer or other spiritual practices, relaxation or meditation, and spiritual healing. Overall MSA indicates sampling adequacy. 

# Determining the number of factors
First, I will run a parallel analysis. From RDocumentation: "``Parallel" analyis is a technique that compares the scree of factors of the observed data with that of a random data matrix of the same size as the original."  
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Convert acams to numerics for parallel analysis
acams[] <- lapply(acams, function(x) as.numeric(as.character(x)))
str(acams)
#acams2 <- acams + 1
#str(acams2)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#nofactors <- fa.parallel(acams, fm = "ml", fa = "fa", main = "Parallel Analysis Scree Plots", cor = "tet")
#nofactors
# Ran with both the acams data and the tetrachoric correlation matrix obtained from hetcor to be sure the analysis is the same. Eigenvalues are the same in both parallel analyses. 
nofactors <- fa.parallel(het.mat, n.obs = 6157, fm = "ml", fa = "fa", main = "Parallel Analysis Scree Plots- hetmat")
```
I received many warning messages stating "A cell entry of 0 was replaced with correct =  0.5.  Check your data!" This has to do with continuity when computing a tetrachoric correlation matrix. I added 1 to all values in the dataframe to check that the issue was not the 0/1 values. The results were the same. 

From Statistics of DOOM notes: 
i.	The dark line is set at one, which is part of the Kaiser criterion. This method is an older rule of thumb that is not well supported anymore.  You would look at the number of eigenvalues that are greater than 1 (or .70 in new literature).  This rule tends to overestimate the number of factors/components needed.
ii.	The red dotted line is the random data set used to test this analysis. Your data is randomly reordered to see how many factors are better than chance. 
iii.	The blue line and triangles are your eigenvalues from the real dataset. 
iv.	You want to look at where the blue and red lines cross. 

The parallel analysis suggests 6 factors. This is where the lines cross. Looking at the scree plot, none of the drop offs appear to be very large. Seems like there are maybe 2 factors. 

Note: Scree plots are a visual depiction of the eigenvalues. Look for the large drop off to figure out how many factors to use.

# Kaiser Criterion 
```{r}
# older kaiser criterion, number of eigenvalues greater than 1 
sum(nofactors$fa.values > 1.0)
# new kaiser criterion, number of eigenvalues greater than 0.7
sum(nofactors$fa.values > .7)
```
New kaiser criterion rule (eigenvalues greater than 0.7) suggests 2 factors. 

After readings Ayers and Kronenfeld (2010), I will test the old CAM domains posted by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), now the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine (NCCIM). Then I will test the domains found by Ayers and Kronenfeld (2010). Finally, I will test the NCCIM's current CAM domains before performing exploratory factor analysis on the MIDUS data. 

# Old NCCAM Domains 
NCCAM domains: 
- Mind-Body Treatments: hypnosis, meditation, guided imagery, relaxation, deep breathing, pray for self, others pray, prayer groups, healing rituals, biofeedback 
- Alternative Medical Systems: Acupuncture, ayurveda, folk medicine, naturopathy, homeopathy
- Manipulative Treatments: Chiropractic, massage
- Biologically based practices: herbs, vitamins. 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Specify the model
#NCCAM.model <- 'mindBody =~ aHypnosis + aRelaxMeditate + aImageryTech + aPrayer + aSpiritHeal + aBiofeedback
#                alternativeSystems =~ aAcupuncture + aHomeopathy + aExerciseMove 
#                manipulativeTreatments =~ aChiropractic + aMassage
#                biologicalBased =~ aVitamins + aHerbal + a SpecialDiet'

#acams[sapply(acams, is.numeric)] <- lapply(acams[sapply(acams, is.numeric)], as.factor) # convert all columns to factors


# Fit the model 
#fit <- cfa(NCCAM.model, data = acams, ordered = TRUE)

# display summary output
#summary(fit, fit.measures = TRUE)
```

# 1-6 Factor Models with all CAM variables 
All models run using oblique rotation (factors are allowed to correlate when rotated) and maximum likelihood estimation. 

## Factor loadings: 1 Factor Model with all CAM variables
```{r, echo = FALSE}
allvar_1 <- fa(r = het.mat, nfactors = 1, n.obs=nrow(acams), rotate = "oblimin", fm = "ml")
allvar_1$loadings
```
### Reliability: 1 Factor Model
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ML1 <- c(1:15)
allvar1_ML1 <- psych::alpha(acams[, ML1])
allvar1_ML1$total
```
Raw alpha is 0.695 - Acceptable? 

## Factor loadings: 2 Factor model with all CAM variables 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
allvar_2 <- fa(r = het.mat, nfactors = 2, n.obs=nrow(acams), rotate = "oblimin", fm = "ml")
allvar_2$loadings
```
All items only load onto one factor. 

Ml1 includes spiritual healing and prayer.
All other items load onto ML2. 

ML2 accounts for 40% of the variance. ML1 accounts for 12% of the variance. Cumulatively this factor model accounts for 52% of the variance. 

The factors are correlated (r = 0.51).

### Reliability: 2 Factor Model
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ML1 <- c(12, 15)
ML2 <- c(1:11, 13:14)
allvar2_ML1 <- psych::alpha(acams[, ML1])
allvar2_ML1$total
```
Raw alpha for ML1 (prayer and spiritual healing) is very low, 0.29
```{r, echo = FALSE}
allvar2_ML2 <- psych::alpha(acams[, ML2])
allvar2_ML2$total
```
Raw alpha for ML2 (all except prayer and spiritual healing) is acceptable(?), 0.68.

## Factor Loadings: 3 Factor model all CAM variables 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
allvar_3 <- fa(r = het.mat, nfactors = 3, n.obs=nrow(acams), rotate = "oblimin", fm = "ml")
allvar_3$loadings
```
Prayer loads onto two factors (ML1 and ML2). 
ML1: prayer, biofeedback, hypnosis, imagery techniques, meditation
ML2: prayer and spiritual healing 
ML3: special diet, acupuncture, chiropractice, energy healing, exercise/movement, herbal, vitamins, homeopathy, and massage

## Factor Loadings: 4 Factor model all CAM variables 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
allvar_4 <- fa(r = het.mat, nfactors = 4, n.obs=nrow(acams), rotate = "oblimin", fm = "ml")
allvar_4$loadings
```

Energy healing loads on three factors. 
Prayer loads on two factors. 
ML1: prayer, energy healing, spirit healing
ML2: energy healing, biofeedback, hypnosis, imagery techniques, meditation 
ML3: prayer 
ML4: Acupuncture, Chiropractic, Exercise, Herbal, Vitamins, Homeopathy, Massage, Special Diet

## Factor Loadings: 5 Factor model all CAM variables 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
allvar_5 <- fa(r = het.mat, nfactors = 5, n.obs=nrow(acams), rotate = "oblimin", fm = "ml")
allvar_5$loadings
```
Diet doesn't load on any factors 
Prayer loads on two factors. 
Energy healing loads on three factors. 

ML1: Prayer
ML2: Exercise and massage
ML3: Energy, Biofeedback, Hypnosis, ImageryTech, RelaxMeditate
ML4: prayer, energy, spiritual healing 
ML5: Acupuncture, Chiropractic, Herbal, Vitamins, Homeopathy

## Factor Loadings: 6 Factor model all CAM variables 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
allvar_6 <- fa(r = het.mat, nfactors = 6, n.obs=nrow(acams), rotate = "oblimin", fm = "ml")
allvar_6$loadings
```
Energy healing loads on 3 factors. 
Prayer and exercise are only items to load on their factors. 

## Diagrams of factor loadings 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
fa.diagram(allvar_2, cut = .299, sort = TRUE)
fa.diagram(allvar_3, cut = .299, sort = TRUE)
fa.diagram(allvar_4, cut = .299, sort = TRUE)
fa.diagram(allvar_5, cut = .299, sort = TRUE)
fa.diagram(allvar_6, cut = .299, sort = TRUE)
```

## Compare model fit for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 factor models including all variables 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
efa <- function(df,   #correlation matrix  
                k) {      #number of factors
  foreach(i=1:k, .packages="psych") %dopar% fa(df, 
                                               nfactors=i,
                                               n.obs=6157,
                                               rotate="oblimin",
                                               fm="ml"
  )
}

# Creates a table that compares the models. 
compare_models <- function(model) {
  table_efa <- data.frame(Model=0, TLI=0, BIC=0, RMSR=0, RMSEA=0, RMSEA_lower_bound=0, RMSEA_upper_bound=0, RMSEA_confidence=0, CFI=0)   #empty data.frame to prealocate memory. 
  for(i in 1:length(model)){
    table_efa [i,1] <- paste("Model", i)
    table_efa [i,2] <- model[[i]]$TLI
    table_efa [i,3] <- model[[i]]$BIC
    table_efa [i,4] <- model[[i]]$rms
    table_efa [i,5:8] <- model[[i]]$RMSEA
    table_efa [i, 9] <- 1 - ((model[[i]]$STATISTIC-model[[i]]$dof)/(model[[i]]$null.chisq-model[[i]]$null.dof))
  }
  return(table_efa)
}

test <- efa(het.mat, 6)
model_fit_all_vars <- compare_models(test)
rownames(model_fit_all_vars) <- c('1 Factor Mode', '2 Factor Model', '3 Factor Model', '4 Factor Model', '5 Factor Model', '6 Factor Model')
model_fit_all_vars
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
# Get CFI
#finalmodel <- round1 
#1 - ((finalmodel$STATISTIC-finalmodel$dof)/(finalmodel$null.chisq-finalmodel$null.dof))
```
# Different rotations, all CAMs

## 1 Factor model, Varimax rotation 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
allvar_varimax1 <- fa(r = het.mat, nfactors = 1, n.obs=nrow(acams), rotate = "varimax", fm = "ml")
allvar_varimax1$loadings
```
## Four factor, varimax rotation
```{r, echo = FALSE}
allvar_varimax4 <- fa(r = het.mat, nfactors = 4, n.obs=nrow(acams), rotate = "varimax", fm = "ml")
allvar_varimax4$loadings
```
## Four factor, promax rotation
```{r, echo = FALSE}
allvar_promax4 <- fa(r = het.mat, nfactors = 4, n.obs=nrow(acams), rotate = "promax", fm = "ml")
allvar_promax4$loadings
```

# Principal components factor analysis 
## Four factor with varimax
```{r, echo = false}
allvar_PCApromax4 <- principal(r = het.mat, nfactors = 4, rotate="varimax",n.obs=nrow(acams))
allvar_PCApromax4$loadings
```

# Run factor model without prayer and spiritual healing 
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
# Remove aPrayer and aSpiritHeal from acams
acams13 <- subset(acams, select = -c(aPrayer, aSpiritHeal))
str(acams13)
# convert all columns to factors. This is important for the tetrachoric correlations. They are much smaller when run as numeric. 
# Checked against tetrachoric matrix produced by Stata; they are the same when hetcor is run on factors in R.
# Will have to convert back to numeric for parallel analysis. 
acams13[sapply(acams13, is.numeric)] <- lapply(acams13[sapply(acams13, is.numeric)], as.factor)
str(acams13)
# Create correlation matrix 
het.mat13 <- hetcor(acams13)$cor
```
## Tetrachoric correlations (excluding prayer and spiritual healing)
```{r, echo = FALSE}
cor.plot(het.mat13, numbers=T, upper=FALSE, main = "Tetrachoric Correlations excluding prayer and spiritual healing ", show.legend = TRUE, xlas = 2)
```

## Test for correlation adequacy 

Bartlett's test for sphericity. 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Correlation adequacy Bartlett's test
cortest.bartlett(het.mat13, n = nrow(acams))
```
Items are adequately correlated. 

## Test for sampling adequacy 

MSA cutoffs: >.9 marvelous, .8s meritorious, .7s middling, .6s mediocre, .5s miserable, less than .5 is unacceptable.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
KMO(het.mat13)
```
All variables meet requirements for sampling adequacy. 

## Determining number of factors 

### Parallel Analysis 
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Convert acams13 to numeric for parallel analysis
acams13[] <- lapply(acams13, function(x) as.numeric(as.character(x)))
str(acams13)
#acams2 <- acams + 1
#str(acams2)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
nofactors13 <- fa.parallel(acams13, fm = "ml", fa = "fa", main = "Parallel Analysis Scree Plots excluding prayer and spiritual healing", cor = "tet")
```
The parallel analysis suggests 5 factors. There is a drop off on the scree plot after 4. 

### Kaiser Criterion 
```{r}
# older kaiser criterion, number of eigenvalues greater than 1 
sum(nofactors13$fa.values > 1.0)
# new kaiser criterion, number of eigenvalues greater than 0.7
sum(nofactors13$fa.values > .7)
```
The Kaiser criterion suggests there is only 1 factor. The Kaiser criterion tends to over estimate factors. Doesn't seem good that it's only estimating 1. 

## Factor Loadings: 1 factor model excluding prayer and spiritual healing 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
exprayheal_1 <- fa(r = het.mat13, nfactors = 1, n.obs=6157, rotate = "oblimin", fm = "ml")
exprayheal_1$loadings
```
### Reliability: 1 Factor Model excluding prayer and spiritual healing 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ML1 <- c(1:13)
exprayheal1_ML1 <- psych::alpha(acams13[, ML1])
exprayheal1_ML1$total
```
Removing prayer and spiritual healing does not improve the reliability at all. Raw alpha is almost exactly the same, 0.68. Lowers reliability slightly (from 0.695). 

## Factor Loadings: 3 factor model excluding prayer and spiritual healing 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
exprayheal_3 <- fa(r = het.mat13, nfactors = 3, n.obs=6157, rotate = "oblimin", fm = "ml")
exprayheal_3$loadings
```

Energy healing loads on two factors. 

### Reliability: 3 Factor Model excluding prayer and spiritual healing 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ML3 <- c(1, 6:8, 13)
ML1 <- c(2, 9:10, 12)
ML2 <- c(3, 5, 11)
exprayheal3_ML3 <- psych::alpha(acams13[, ML3])
exprayheal3_ML3$total
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
exprayheal3_ML1 <- psych::alpha(acams13[, ML1])
exprayheal3_ML1$total
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
exprayheal3_ML2 <- psych::alpha(acams13[, ML2])
exprayheal3_ML2$total
```

## Factor Loadings: 4 factor model excluding prayer and spiritual healing 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
exprayheal_4 <- fa(r = het.mat13, nfactors = 4, n.obs=6157, rotate = "oblimin", fm = "ml")
exprayheal_4$loadings
```
Massage and energy heal load on two factors. 

## Factor loadings: 5 factor model excluding prayer and spiritual healing
```{r, echo = FALSE}
exprayheal_5 <- fa(r = het.mat13, nfactors = 5, n.obs=nrow(acams), rotate = "oblimin", fm = "ml")
exprayheal_5$loadings
```
Exercise/movement and energy healing load on two factors

All items now load on a factor. All items only load onto one factor (great!). Energy healing is now loading onto the same factor as acupuncture, herbal therapy, vitamins, and homeopathy. I am not sure why an item would change factors after dropping items that did not load. 

### Model fit 

#### Goodness of fit statistics
TLI equals 0.985 - great! 
The comparitive fit index (CFI) equals
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Get CFI
finalmodel <- round3 
1 - ((finalmodel$STATISTIC-finalmodel$dof)/(finalmodel$null.chisq-finalmodel$null.dof))
```

Also great!

#### Residual fit statistics 
(RMSR) is  0.01, indicating excellent fit. RMSEA is 0.019, indicating excellent fit. 

### Reliability Assessment 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
factor1 <- c(1, 3, 5:7)
factor2 <- c(8, 10)
factor3 <- c(2, 9)
factor4 <- c(4, 11)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
psych::alpha(acams11[ , factor1])
```
Raw alpha for factor 1 (acupuncture, energy healing, herbal, vitamins, and homeopathy) is 0.59 . 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
psych::alpha(acams11[ , factor2])
```
Raw alpha for factor 2 (imagery techniques and meditation) is 0.48 . 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
psych::alpha(acams11[ , factor3])
```
Raw alpha for factor 3 ( chiropractic and massage) is 0.40 . 

```{r, echo = FALSE }
psych::alpha(acams11[ , factor4])
```
Raw alpha for factor 4 (exercise and diet) is 0.40 .
