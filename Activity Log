# 2020-02-28 Friday 
- Downloaded MIDUS 1 from ICPSR: Project 1 and Project 2 (survey and daily 
experiences- no cog or bio for MIDUS1)

# 2020-03-04 
- August 7th is the latest I can defend to graduate in May. 
- Do data cleaning and as much analysis as I need to to keep things moving in stata. 
- Data cleaning: 40 hours; 5 hours per week, March and April 
- Created THE PLAN with lisannette.
- Alcohol variable: Found in daily diary data. Available for M1 and M2, A2DB9 and B2DB3
- Cigarette variable: Found in daily diary data. M1 and M2. A2DB8 and B2DB2
- Need to merge daily diary 

# 2020-03-06
- Gah really want to code and clean in R. 
- Reading on data cleaning in R steps. 

# 2020-03-09
- Meeting with Terrence today- talk with him about biomarkers. 
- To do: CAM variables, SES variables, THL variables, health variables, controls. 
- Finish coding by end of March. 13 hours per week. Working on CAM recodes for MIDUS1 now. 
- Stopped at line 56 in data-cleaning.R

# 2020-03-10
- Adding cig and alcohol variables from MIDUS2 daily diary to MIDUS2 data 
- Rearranged MIDUS2 R git folders to match the merge+subset-MIDUS2 r script (stored in INFO 523 folder right now) 
- Start writing data description this week so that I understand it more and so I can get feedback from Terrence on 
what to do with the twins/siblings/missing data. 
- SCRIPT FLOW: Renaming MIDUS2 vars; so far two r scripts to be run (1) Merge, (2) Renaming. 
- Renamed MIDUS2 CAM vars, SES, and health outcomes (biomarkers and chronic conditions) 
- MAJOR WIN! Found diet and exercise variables in the biomarker data for MIDUS2. Located under Biomarker>Medical 
History on the collectia portal site. Added to the MIDUS2vars.txt doc 
- Renamed insurance, locus of control, religious/spiritual, and traditional health behaviors variables in the 
renaming script. 

# 2020-03-11
- to do: rename controls (age, race, ethnicity, sex, marital status) 
- Clean: CAMs, SES, health outcomes, traditional health behaviors, controls (insurance, LOC, religious/spirituality, 
age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status)
- Added biomarker diet and exercise variables to the merged file. 
- Finished renaming MIDUS2 variables. Refined Merge script- down to 100 variables. 
- Completed tutorial on regular expressions to help with editing code quickly
- Tomorrow: start by cleaning CAMs, create dummy variables and an index.  

# 2020-03-12
- Labeled MIDUS2 variables in Renaming script. 
- Scripts so far: 1-Merge, 2-Rename, 3-cleaning. MIDUS2 output data for each is MIDUS2-# to corresponding script. 
E.g. output for 1-merge is MIDUS2-1, output for 2-Rename is MIDUS2-2.
- Named the dataframe (NOT FILE) MIDUS2 in the merge file. So even when saved as different file names it shows up as MIDUS2 in the global 
environment... Not sure what to do about it. Leaving as is. 
- https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-code-best-practices/ r code best practices- implement soon. 
- Converted bcams to dummies, factors, and labeled values. 
- Next R lab- ask Jeff how to go about checking recodes in R. I mutated the columns, so cannot compare to old vars. 
- Do first tomorrow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38544325/rowsums-na-na-gives-0 Rows with all NAs go to 0 in bCamCount. Need to fix. In 
3-cleaning script. 

# 2020-03-13
- Starting with the NAs problems in the cam count index; Success! 
- Read up on tidy data; reading up on editrules package 
- Finding editrules very confusing right now. Moving on to coding and cleaning other variables 
- Started SES inspection, but would like to write edit rules... Trying to figure that out 
- Do first next session: start writing edit rules or just keep checking variables in MIDUS2 so I can do association rules by Wednesday next week.

# 2020-03-19
- Just checked in. Tomorrow: start writing edit rules! You got this.
