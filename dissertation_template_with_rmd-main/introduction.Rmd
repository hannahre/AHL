# Introduction

The association between greater socioeconomic resources and better
health is well documented. Higher socioeconomic status is associated
with better self-reported health [@link2008; @meyer2014], better mental
health [@hill2014; @ross2006], lower mortality risk [@bosworth2018;
@duncan2002; @laaksonen2007; @link2008; @lleras-muney2005; @ross2012],
lower infant mortality rates [@bleich2012], lower rates of obesity
[@bleich2012; @cutler2006; @cutler2010; @mirowsky1998; @ross1999], fewer
chronic conditions [@bleich2012; @herd2007; @link2008], and fewer
functional limitations [@herd2007]. Health behaviors are responsible for
part of this association [@adler1994; @adler2008; @brunello2016;
@burdette2008; @lantz1998; @lantz2001]. Higher socioeconomic status is
associated with increased physical activity, better diet, healthier
alcohol consumption, non-smoking, more frequent seatbelt use,
utilization of preventive healthcare, and use of smoke detectors
[@bleich2012; @cutler2010; @meyer2014; @pampel2010]. The study of health
behaviors has made significant contributions to our understanding of
associations between social statuses and health [@pampel2010], and there
is now substantial evidence that health behaviors cluster to form
discernible health lifestyles [@andrews2017; @berrigan2003; @burke1997;
@cockerham2007; @dodd2010; @mize2017; @patterson1994; @saintonge2017;
@schuit2002; @devries2008].

These health lifestyles are patterns of health behaviors that co-occur
more than would be expected if health behaviors were independent
[@berrigan2003]. Studies utilizing a variety of methods to identify
behavior patterns have found that health behaviors cluster into health
lifestyles, and sometimes do so in counterintuitive ways [@andrews2017;
@burdette2017; @dodd2010; @hill2007; @lawrence2017; @mize2017;
@mollborn2014; @patterson1994; @saintonge2017; @devries2008]. Recent
latent class analyses of multiple health behaviors have confirmed the
existence of distinct, multi-dimensional health lifestyles
[@burdette2017; @lawrence2017; @mize2017; @saintonge2017]. Within this
new research stream, however, the study of health lifestyles has largely
focused on behaviors of traditional concern to public health. The most
common combination of behaviors within lifestyles research is alcohol
use, smoking, diet, and exercise. An entire subset of health behaviors,
the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs), has been
virtually ignored.

In sum, SES consistently explains disparities in health outcomes, and
part of this association is explained by variations in health behaviors.
Recent studies have found that SES is related to patterns of health
behavior, but have failed to examine SES patterns in CAM use. As will be
discussed below, previous research has identified associations between
SES and overall CAM use, however SES associations with patterns of CAMs
have been neglected. The overarching research question addressed by this
dissertation is whether CAMs form a lifestyle that contributes to the
SES-health relationship. Chapter 2 addresses the question of whether
patterns in CAM use form a discernible alternative health lifestyle.
Chapter 3 addresses the question of whether alternative health lifestyle
is associated with SES, and whether alternative health lifestyle
contributes to better health for those with higher SES. Chapter 4
addresses the question of whether SES moderates behavioral response to a
change in health status, a critical moment in shaping future health and
wellness. I will address these questions using data from the Midlife in
the United States (MIDUS) study, a longitudinal, nationally
representative data set of U.S. adults.

In the sections below, I review research on CAM use, its association
with socioeconomic status, its association with health, and motivations
for using CAMs. Following a review of relevant theoretical perspectives
on health lifestyles and SES, I discuss the contributions of this
dissertation to the literature on health lifestyles and SES.

# General CAM Use

About a third of U.S. adults report the use of any CAMs [@barnes2008;
@clarke2015], and CAM use appears to be increasing with younger cohorts
[@kessler2001]. @clarke2015 found that out of the 20 CAM behaviors
included in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) CAM Supplement
collected in 2002, 2007, and 2012, the use of nonvitamin, nonmineral
dietary supplements was highest across all three time points, followed
by deep breathing exercises. The use of yoga, tai chi, and qi gong
became more popular over time, and meditation ranked in the top 5 most
popular approaches at each time point. The use of other CAMs, including
Ayurveda, biofeedback, guided imagery hypnosis, and energy health
therapy, have not changed significantly over time.

The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine (NCCIM)
classifies CAMs into five broad categories: biologically based therapies
(including herbal medicine, vitamin use, and special diets), alternative
medical systems (including acupuncture and homeopathy), manipulative
body-based therapies (including massage therapy, exercise and movement
therapies, and chiropractic therapy), mind-body therapies (including
hypnosis, imagery techniques, and meditation), and energy healing
therapies (use of hands to manipulate and balance energy fields).
@barnes2008 found that 19.9% of adults report using biologically based
therapies, 19.2% report using mind-body therapies, 3.4% report using
alternative medical systems, 0.5% report using energy healing therapy,
and 15.2% report using manipulative and body-based therapies.

# Trends in CAM Use by SES

Those with higher levels of education tend to use CAMs at higher rates
[@barnes2008; @clarke2015; @honda2005; @mbizo2018; @ni2002;
@upchurch2018]. For example, @clarke2015 found that 15.6%-18.8% of
adults with less than a high school diploma reported CAM use in 2002,
2007, and 2012 surveys. In contrast, 24.4%-28.1% of adults with a high
school diploma or GED, 35.6-41.3% of adults with some college education,
and 42.1%-46.7% of adults iwth a college degree or high reported CAM use
[@clarke2015]. @barnes2008 reported the following rates of CAM use in
2007 for six educational categories: 20.8% of adults with less than high
school, 31.0% of adults with a high school diploma or equivalent, 45% of
adults with some college, 47.2% of adults with an Associates degree,
49.6% of those with a Bachelors, and 55.4% of those with a Masters,
Doctorate, or Professional degree. @hildreth2007 also found that use of
any CAMs increased by level of education; however, among those that used
any CAM in the past year, the authors found a threshold effect. Only
those with a college degree or more used significantly more types of
CAMs compared to those without a high school diploma.

Findings on the rate of CAM use by income have been mixed across
studies. @mbizo2018 found that significant differences in overall CAM
use across five income categories. Overall CAM use increased by income
across the first four income categories; however, the highest income
category (\$75,000+) only reported greater use than the lowest income
category (\<\$20,000). Among those who have utilized CAMs in the past
year, @hildreth2007 did not find a significant association between
income and any CAM use or number of CAMs utilized. @clarke2015 found
that CAM use was higher for non-poor adults (measured as poverty-income
ratio), followed by near poor, and lowest among the poor across 2002,
2007, and 2012. CAM use ranged from 20.6%-26.6% among the poor, from
25.5%-27.7% among the near poor, and 36.8%-40.3% among the not poor.
Similarly, @ni2002 found that those making less than \$20,000 per year
reported less CAM use than those making \$20,000 per year or more.

# CAM Efficacy

Evidence of efficacy varies across CAMs and across health conditions.
CAM efficacy is important because if CAMs are not effective for
improving health then they are unlikely to mediate the SES-health
relationship. In the following sections, I will review evidence of CAM
efficacy for four categories of CAMs that I can measure using the MIDUS
surveys. (These categories reflect the factors identified in an
exploratory factor analysis that will be reviewed in Chapter 2).
Categories of CAMs include mind-body medicine, alternative medical
systems, physical and nutritional approaches, and manipulative
treatments.

## Mind-Body Medicines

Mind-body medicines or practices represent an array of techniques that
aim to connect the body and mind to improve health and wellness.
Mind-body medicines include prayer or spiritual healing, energy healing,
imagery techniques, relaxation and meditation techniques, and hypnosis.

The MIDUS surveys ask respondents if they have used energy healing in
the past year. Evidence for the efficacy of energy healing is weak. For
example, Reiki is a form of energy healing that involves noninvasive,
nonmanipulative touch. It is performed by a practitioner who has been
"attuned" by a Reiki master. When performed, the practitioner lightly
lays their hands on or just above the body, working in a slow
progression about the body. In a review of clinical studies conducted
between 1998 and 2016, @mcmanus2017 identified 13 studies that compared
the effects of Reiki to a sham Reiki/placebo. Eight of the 13 studies
found that Reiki was more effective than a placebo for producing
physical relaxation [@witte2001; @baldwin2006; @baldwin2008;
@díaz-rodríguez2011; @salles2014] and for reducing pain, depression, and
anxiety among chronically ill patients [@dressen1998]. Studies have also
found that Reiki decreases depression among older adults living in
nursing homes compared to a placebo and control group [@erdogan2016].

The MIDUS surveys also ask about use of imagery techniques, also known
as guided imagery or mental imagery. Imagery techniques involve
imagining a scene or experience in the "mind's eye" absent external
stimuli, and are often used to reduce stress [@clarke2015]. Experimental
studies have also found imagery techniques can reduce pain perception
and increase pain tolerance [@milling2003; @alden2001]. Studies on the
effectiveness of imagery techniques for treating asthma symptoms have
yielded mixed results. @freeman2005 found that biologically target
imagery techniques resulted in significant improvement across several
asthma related outcomes, while @epstein2004 found no significant effect.
In other words, the use of imagery techniques may or may not mediate the
SES-health relationship, but its effects are likely weak.

Meditation is a Buddhist practice that aims to increase awareness of the
present moment and one's experience. It has been investigated as a
possible treatment for chronic pain, showing promising evidence of its
effectiveness. In a randomized controlled trial of 282 participants,
@morone2017 found that an 8 week mindfulness based stress reduction
program effectively reduced self-reported pain disability among adults
with low back pain, though the effects of the program did not hold at
the 6 month follow-up. @garland2014 tested the effectiveness of an 8
week mindfulness intervention program for treating chronic pain in
opioid-abusing patients in a randomized controlled trial. The authors
found that the treatment groups experienced significantly lower pain
severity and pain interference, and that the mindfulness intervention
was more effective than enrollment in a support group. @cherkin2016
compared a mindfulness based stress reduction program, cognitive
behavioral therapy, and usual care in a study of 342 adults ages 20 to
70 years old with chronic low back pain. The authors found that the
mindfulness intervention was more effective at improving back pain and
functional limitations at 26 weeks compared to usual care. Research has
also examined mindfulness techniques as a possible treatment for
headaches, although mindfulness techniques did not reduce the frequency,
length, or pain intensity of headaches compared to usual care
[@anheyer2019]. Research ha similarly studied the utility of imagery
techniques as a treatment for pain and has found them to be possibly
effective treating pain in postoperative orthopedic patients
[@carpenter2017] and cancer patients [@depaolis2019].

Research has also found mind-body practices to be largely effective for
treating anxiety, depression, and stress [@breedvelt2019;
@cillessen2019]. In a sample of adults experiencing moderate sleep
disturbances, @black2015 found that mindfulness meditation improved
depression symptoms in addition to improving sleep and fatigue.
Meditation also reduces anxiety and depression in patients with chronic
heart failure [@sullivan2009; @jayadevappa2007], patients experiencing
acute depression [@strauss2014], and patients with treatment resistant
depression [@eisendrath2016]. Imagery techniques also decrease anxiety
and depression in the general population[@klaus2000; @nguyen2018] as
well as in patients with cancer [@depaolis2019; @mahdizadeh2019],
chronic heart failure [@chang2004], and undergoing hemodialysis
[@beizaee2018].

Despite the mixed results of studies of the efficacy of individual
mind-body CAMs for improving health, the effectiveness of a combination
of techniques on well-being as a whole is unknown. Does the use of one
or more mind-body techniques improve health and well-being? Also, does
the use of mind-body CAMs play a role in the better health outcomes of
higher SES groups?

## Alternative Medicines

Alternative medicines or alternative medical systems reflect CAMs based
on complete systems of theory and practice. The MIDUS surveys ask
respondents about use of homeopathy, herbal therapy, and acupuncture.

Homeopathy is a medical system that originated in Germany more than 200
years ago. There are two underlying theories to homeopathy. The first is
"like cures like," which posits that a disease may be treated with a
substance that "produces similar symptoms in healthy people." The second
is the "law of minimum dose," which posits that lower doses of
medication increase effectiveness. Homeopathic treatments consist of
plant products, minerals, and animal products. Treatments are
individualized to suit each person. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
of randomized controlled trials have found little to no support for
homeopathy's effectiveness.In large, high quality trials homeopathy
fails to outperform the placebo @shang2005. A review by @altunç2007 did
not find evidence for homeopathy's effectiveness for treating asthma,
upper respiratory infection, conjunctivitis, or warts. Some studies
found support homeopathy's effective treatment of acute otitis media and
postoperative pain-agitation syndrome, though these results need to be
replicated. Similarly, a review of 11 independent systematic reviews did
not provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of homeopathy
[@ernst2002]. Indeed the more rigorous the trial the smaller the effects
sizes became. Despite the lack of evidence, practitioners and users of
homeopathy swear by its effectiveness and present plenty of anecdotal
evidence. @ernst2008 posits that the answer to this contradiction is
likely either due to a placebo effect or the fact that sometimes
symptoms simply improve on their own regardless of treatment. Given the
weak evidence from clinical trials for homeopathy's effectiveness it is
unlikely that homeopathy contributes to the SES-health relationship.

Herbal therapy refers to the use of plants to improve health and treat
disease. With regards to efficacy, it is not possible to make
generalizations about herbal therapy's overall effectiveness. Each herb
must be tested for its own effectiveness in treatment and prevention of
specific diseases [@ernst2005]. Most have not been subjected to
extensive clinical testing, though some of the more popular herbal
medicines have been investigated for effectiveness. For example,
garlic's anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-fungal, anti-hypertensive,
blood-glucose lowering anti-thrombotic, anti-mutagenic, and
anti-platelet activities have been identified [@ernst2005]. Research has
found weak evidence that garlic reduces total cholesterol and
low-density lipoprotein [@stevinson]. With regard to blood pressure,
there is evidence garlic has a small anti-hypertensive effect
[@silagy1994], reduces blood pressure [@ried2008], and may prevent the
development of arteriosclerosis [@breithaupt-grögler1997]. Studies have
further identified uses for garlic eradicating brain cancer cells
[@das2007] and decreasing the odds of developing lung cancer [@jin2013].

Ginkgo biloba has been promoted as a supplement for conditions including
anxiety, allergies, dementia, eye problems, peripheral artery disease,
and tinnitus [@ernst1999], though overall evidence for ginkgo in
treating health conditions is weak
[@nationalcenterforcomplementaryandalternativemedicine]. Ginkgo biloba
has been shown to be effective in delaying clinical deterioration of
dementia in patients and to bring about symptom improvement
[@ernst1999], though it has not been determined whether the herb also
improves cognitive function in healthy individuals [@canter2007].

Ginseng has been the subject of many studies on effectiveness for a
variety of health purposes. Research has found that ginseng improves
glucose metabolism and moderates immune system response [@shergis2013],
assists in maintaining homeostasis of the immune system, and enhances
resistance to illness or microbial attacks through the regulation of the
immune system [@wee2011], suggesting beneficial effects for controlling
inflammatory diseases and microbial infections [@kang2012]. Ginger has
also shown promise as a preventive of cancer [@wee2011; @helmes2004] and
is associated with lower risk of stomach, lung, liver, pancreas,
ovarian, colon, and oral cancer [@yun2003]. Ginseng may also be
effective in treating type 2 diabetes [@wee2011; @kimura1981;
@chung2001; @dey2003; @sotaniemi1995; @vuksan2008] and protecting
against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's [@wee2011].

Studies on the health benefits of echinacea have largely focused on its
possible effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of upper
respiratory tract infections. It is believed that echinacea stimulates
the immune system
[@nationalcenterforcomplementaryandalternativemedicine]. There is
evidence that echinacea may protect against upper respiratory infections
[@melchart1999] but does not reduce the duration of infection
[@barrett2010; @karsch-völk2014; @david2019] or severity
[@melchart1999].

St. John's Wort has most commonly been recommended for treating
depression, though it has also been suggested as treatment for
menopausal symptoms, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
somatic symptom disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
[@nationalcenterforcomplementaryandalternativemedicine]. Research has
found evidence that St. John's Wort is as effective as antidepressants
in treating depression and is associated with fewer adverse events
[@apaydin2016; @ng2017]. @geller2007 found St. John's Wort to be
effective in treating mood and anxiety in menopausal women. There is
also evidence that hyperforin and hypericin, found in St. John's Wort,
have anticancer properties [@you2018; @klemow2011].

The efficacy of ginger root in treating and preventing has been studied
for many health outcomes. Oxidative stress is associated with numerous
diseases, thus ginger's antioxidant properties have been put forth as a
possible explanation for associated health benefits [@aeschbach1994;
@ahmad2000; @halvorsen2002]. Ginger root has been found to decrease
inflammation, swelling, and pain [@young2005; @minghetti2007;
@eldershaw1992; @ueki2008] and has been proposed as a possible treatment
against inflammation, osteoarthritis, and rheumatism [@reginster2000],
though evidence of its effectiveness has been inconsistent
[@marcus2001]. Ginger's anticarcinogenic activities have been explored
for the possible prevention and suppression of lymphoma, hepatoma,
colorectal cancer, breast cancer, skin cancer, liver cancer, and bladder
cancer [@bode2011]. Furthermore evidence suggests that the various
properties of ginger may be effective in treating cardiovascular disease
[@nicoll2009], asthma [@chen2009], and symptoms of diabetes [@bode2011;
@daily2015].

The MIDUS surveys ask respondents whether they use herbal therapy, but
do not include information on which herbs are used at what dosage or for
what purpose. Thus, while there is evidence to support specific herb's
usefulness in treating specific diseases, it may or may not contribute
to the SES-health relationship observed in the MIDUS data. In the
analyses that follow I try to account for this by including specific
disease outcomes that have been the subject of herbal therapy trials.

The final alternative medical system included in the MIDUS data is
acupuncture. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine in which the
practitioner stimulates specific points in the body typically through
the insertion of thin needles. One of the primary applications studied
for acupuncture has been chronic pain. A meta-analysis of 29 clinical
trials found that acupuncture decreases pain compared to no acupuncture
and sham acupuncture (when needles are inserted into patients' skin but
not as deep as in acupuncture or in the body points specified by
acupuncture) [@vickers2014]. Acupuncture is associated with modest
improvements pain and function among patients with chronic knee pain
[@hinman2015] and a reduction in pain and disability among patients with
chronic neck pain [@becker-witt2004]. Acupuncture is widely used for
treating low back pain, the second most frequently reported reason for
seeing a physician [@manheimer2005]. Acupuncture is significantly more
effective in producing short-term relief of chronic low back pain
compared to sham acupuncture and no treatment [@manheimer2005]. A
randomized controlled trial by @cherkin2009 found similar reductions in
back-related dysfunction for traditional as well as sham acupuncture.
These results indicate that placement of the needling sites may be
unimportant in producing effects, raising questions about the mechanisms
by which acupuncture influences outcomes. It is possible the results
represent a placebo effect. The current research available on
acupuncture's effectiveness in treating chronic headaches demonstrates
that acupuncture is associated with improvement in clinical outcomes
compared to usual care, medical therapy, and sham acupuncture
[@coeytaux2016; @linde2015; @linde2016; @sun2008].

Acupuncture has been studied extensively for its possible utility as a
treatment for depression. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses
have been published examining acupuncture's effectiveness in treating
depression compared to no treatment, usual care, sham acupuncture, and
antidepressant medication. Some meta-analyses have found that
acupuncture is moderately more effective compared to no treatment in
reducing depression symptoms [@smith2018; @zhang2010] while others have
not found this effect [@leo2007; @mukaino2005]. Studies have provided
support for acupuncture's effectiveness over usual care [@armour2019;
@smith2018]. Evidence of acupuncture's effectiveness in reducing
depression symptoms compared to sham acupuncture has been mixed with
some studies finding acupuncture to be more effective [@smith2018],
others finding inconclusive evidence [@mukaino2005], and others finding
no significant difference in effects [@zhang2010; @leo2007]. @smith2018
found acupuncture to be slightly more beneficial compared to medication
therapy, though the authors note that there was substantial variation
across studies depending on the class of medication and mode of
acupuncture stimulation. Compared to medication, @zhang2010 found that
acupuncture led to better improvements in symptom severity in patients
with post-stroke depression. In the overall meta-analysis, the
effectiveness of acupuncture was comparable to antidepressants alone.
@mukaino2005 and @leo2007's analyses showed similar patterns. Results
from @armour2019's meta-analysis showed that acupuncture resulted in
significantly greater reductions in depression severity when used as an
additional therapy to anti-depressant medication. @mukaino2005 on the
other hand report that evidence of acupuncture as an effective adjunct
therapy to antidepressant medication is inconclusive. Given the evidence
from the studies cited, acupuncture may contribute to socioeconomic
variations in chronic pain and depression.

While there is substantial evidence for the effectiveness of some
alternative medical systems, evidence for others is weak. The mixed
results cited above make it unclear what the combined effect of using
alternative medical systems will be on the SES-health relationship. The
analyses in the following chapters will examine whether the use of one
or multiple alternative medical systems improves health and well-being
for higher SES groups.

## Physical and Nutritional Approaches

Physical and nutritional approaches represent another subset of CAMs.
MIDUS surveys include measures of vitamin supplementation, exercise and
movement therapy, and special diet. Below I review evidence from
randomized controlled trials and epidemiological studies on the
effectiveness of each approach in preventing and treating various health
conditions. The evidence below guides the selection of disease outcomes
for analyses of the role of AHL in the SES-health relationship.

The MIDUS surveys ask respondents about general vitamin use, but do not
provide information on the usage of specific vitamins. There are many
different vitamins in use in the United States. To gain some sense of
the effectiveness of vitamin supplementation, I focus on the use and
effectiveness of multivitamin and multimineral (MVMM) supplements.
Studies in this literature have investigated the use of MVMM
supplementation in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular
disease (CVD), cancer, stroke, infection, and blood pressure, as well as
it's relationship to all-cause mortality. Studies have found no
association between MVMM supplementation and stroke mortality or stroke
incidence [@kim2018]. MVMM supplementation significantly reduces
infection episodes in young and middle-aged adults [@stephen2006] and
lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with chronic
disease [@li2018]. Sporadic MVMM supplementation is associated with
increased usual intake of micronutrients, with a greater effect observed
in regular users [@wallace2019]. Prevention trials have found some
evidence of a reduced risk of all-cause mortality associated with MVMM
supplementation [@macpherson2013], though some studies have only
observed this effect in men [@hercberg2004].

Evidence of a relationship between MVMM supplementation and CVD
incidence is overall weak. @alexander2013 review results from 12 cohort
studies and 3 primary prevention randomized controlled trials of the
effect of MVMM supplementation on CVD incidence in healthy adults. The
results of 2 randomized controlled trials show that MVMM is associated
with a lowered incidence of CVD, however the observational
epidemiological studies did not confirm this association. @kim2018 found
that MVMM was associated with lower risk of cardiovascular heart disease
(CHD) incidence, though this relationship did not hold in subgroup
analyses of randomized controlled trials.In a review of 26 studies,
@fortmann2013 report that a majority of the studies did not show a
preventive effect of MVMM supplementation on CVD incidence in healthy
populations. In a recommendation statement published in the Annals of
Internal Medicine in 2014, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
concluded that the current evidence was not sufficient to assess the
benefits and harms of MVMM supplementation for the prevention of CVD
[@moyer2014].

While some preventive effects against cancer have been found for MVMM
supplementation, this in some studies this effect is only observed in
men[@hercberg2004; @gaziano2012]. Two randomized controlled trials of
generally healthy adults reviewed by @alexander2013 found a lower
incidence of cancer in the MVMM supplementation group, though this
association was not confirmed in the observational epidemiological
studies reviewed. Similarly, a majority of the studies reviewed by
@fortmann2013 did not find a preventive effect of MVMM supplementation
on cancer incidence in healthy populations.

The MIDUS surveys ask respondents whether they've utilized exercise or
movement therapy, including yoga. In the following paragraphs, I review
studies on the effects of yoga and physical exercise on health. Yoga is
a practice rooted in India that combines physical postures, breathing
techniques, and meditation to promote physical and mental well-being.
Yoga's effectiveness in promoting health has been examined for several
health outcomes, including headaches, pain, brain structure, and mental
health. Yoga is associated with a reduction in headache frequency,
headache duration, and pain intensity in patients suffering from
tension-type headaches [@anheyer2020]. Yoga has a positive effect on
neck pain intensity, neck pain-related functional disability, and mood
among patients with chronic, nonspecific neck pain [@li2019]. In a
review of 11 studies on the effects of yoga on brain structure,
@gothe2019 found that yoga has a positive effect on the structure and
function of the hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, cingulate
cortex, and brain networks including the default mode network. The
authors conclude that yoga may be a promising intervention for
mitigating age-relate and neurodegenerative declines. Research has found
that yoga significantly reduces depression symptoms compared to
psychoeducation [@vollbehr2018] and usual care [@cramer2013]. The
evidence for yoga's effects on anxiety are mixed [@cramer2013;
@vollbehr2018]. Most type of yoga have a positive effect on stress
reduction in health populations [@wang2020] and is associate with a
significant increase in psychological well-being compared to no
intervention [@hendriks2017].

There is an abundance of evidence for the positive effect of exercise on
health. Physical inactivity is associated with an increased risk of
chronic disease [@anderson2019] including cancer [@magnusson1998] and
diabetes [@uusitupa2000]. Physical activity has been found to reduce
risk of declining health in overweight and obese populations independent
of weight reduction [@he2004]. In combination with adherence to a
Mediterranean diet, moderate alcohol use, and non-smoking, physical
activity is associated with a 50% lower rate of all-cause and
cause-specific mortality [@knoops2004]. In patients with type 2
diabetes, physical activity has been found to decrease systolic blood
pressure, in turn reducing the risk for diabetes-related complications,
diabetes-related death, and myocardial infarction [@adler2000]. Among
cancer patients, physical activity is related to better health-related
quality of life [@calle2002] and reduced risk and disease burden
conveyed by co-morbid conditions [@penedo2004]. Physical activity is
associated with a reduced risk of adverse cardiovascular events
[@wessel2004; @blumenthal2004]. Consistent physical activity has been
shown to prevent the onset of depression [@paffenbargerjr1994] and to
reduce depression and anxiety symptoms [@ross1988; @stephens1988;
@babyak2000].

The final physical and nutritional approach included in the MIDUS survey
is special diet. There are a plethora of dietary patterns and popular
diets observed in the general population. Generally, dietary patterns
characterized by fruit, vegetable, whole grain, fish, and poultry
consumption tend to be related to increased micronutrient intake and
lower disease risk [@kant2004]. More healthful diets are inversely
related to all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease risk, though a
systematic review of dietary studies notes that risk reduction is modest
and tends to be attenuated when controls are introduced [@kant2004]. Low
salt diets are associated with a reduction in death from cardiovascular
disease, and tends to be recommended for heart failure and chronic
kidney disease [@suckling2015]. Over the last couple of decades, many
different diets have gained popularity. The effectiveness of any given
popular diet is something that requires further study, however a
randomized controlled trial of overweight and obese adults comparing
four popular diets (Atkins, Zone, Weight Watchers, and Ornish) found
that diet adherence was a better predictor of weight loss and reduction
of cardiac risk factors than the type of diet used [@dansinger2005].
Plant-based and vegetarian diets have been associated with reduced risk
of negative health outcomes, including lower cholesterol, diabetes,
heart disease, and cancer [@oussalah2020; @mcevoy2012].

While there is strong evidence for the effectiveness of some physical
and nutritional approaches in promoting health, it is unclear what their
effects will be taken together. Analyses in the following chapters will
examine whether use of one or more physical and nutritional approaches
play a role in the SES-health relationship.

## Manipulative Treatments

Manipulative treatments are treatments in which practitioners physically
manipulate the systems and structures of the body, such as bones,
joints, and soft tissues, to improve physical ailments. Manipulative
treatments are based on the belief that the systems and structures of
the body are dependent on each other and self-regulating. The MIDUS
survey asks respondents whether they use two manipulative treatments:
massage and chiropractic care. Evidence indicates that manipulative
treatments may constribute to SES differences in chronic pain and
depression and anxiety.

Massage has been examined as a possible treatment for a variety of pain
conditions. Research has shown that massage is more effective in
treating pain compared to sham controls, no treatment, and active
controls (e.g. joint manipulation, physical therapy, acupuncture)
[@crawford2016]. Among patients with fibromyalgia, massage has been
shown to significantly improve pain after 5 weeks of treatment
[@li2014]. Research has found that massage relieves pain in the short
term in patients with low back pain [@furlan2015; @kumar2013]. Massage
therapy is effective in treating both neck and should pain compared to
inactive therapy [@kong2013]. Compared to active therapies, massage
shows short effects for relieving shoulder pain but not neck pain. In
patients with headaches, massage is associated with a greater reduction
in headache pain compared to a placebo [@moraska2015] and a reduction in
migraine frequency [@happe2016]. Massage therapy has similarly been
associated with improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms
[@hou2010; @li2014; @crawford2016], showing similar effectiveness to
psychotherapy in meta-analyses [@moyer2004].

Chiropractic care has been examined as a possible treatment for several
health outcomes. @salehi2015 reviewed 11 systematic reviews that were
specifically concerned with chiropractic care effectiveness and included
evidence from clinical trials focused on as specific disease. Results
showed that chiropractic care may effectively improve neck pain,
shoulder and neck trigger points, and sports injuries. The authors found
no conclusive evidence for chiropractic care's effectiveness in treating
asthma, infant colic, autism spectrum disorder, gastrointestinal
problems, fibromyalgia, back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome.

# Motivations for CAM Use

With such variation in efficacy, what motivates CAM use? A range of
motivations have been considered by previous literature, including
perceptions of effectiveness and safety, congruence with spiritual
philosophy and health beliefs, a sense of control over one's health,
dissatisfaction with conventional medicine, and treatment of specific
conditions, particularly chronic pain [@barnes2008; @ernst2000;
@greene2009; @sirois2002]. Whereas the effectiveness of CAMs has been
mixed in clinical trials, CAM users report both physical and
psychological health benefits, such as improved physical functioning,
relief of negative physical symptoms, improved coping and resilience,
and decreased symptoms of depression and anxiety [@greene2009].
Perceived effectiveness of CAMs among users appears to be amplified by a
motivation toward general health and wellness. Drawing on 2012 National
Health Interview Survey data, @rhee2018 found that compared to
individuals who use CAMs for treatment only, individuals who utilize
CAMs for general wellness in addition to the treatment of specific
conditions report a better sense of control over their health and
improved overall health. This may indicate that CAM use has particularly
positive perceived benefits for those who are consciously motivated
toward general health and well-being.

# Theoretical Perspectives on Health Lifestyles and Socioeconomic Status

In this section, I discuss theoretical perspectives on health lifestyles
and socioeconomic status. I first discuss two general theories of
stratification and health. Then, I discuss theoretical perspectives
relevant to the components of socioeconomic status. All theories point
to similar conclusions, namely that higher SES is associated with
resources that can be leveraged to gain better health. Health behaviors
are one pathway through which the resources associated with SES are
utilized to improve health and well-being. Some theories argue that high
SES individuals experience better health in part due to patterns of
health behaviors associated with their status group. These theories
predict that health promoting behaviors will cluster at higher rates
within high SES groups. CAMs are a subset of health behaviors that are
more common among high SES individuals and promote health. This
dissertation investigates whether this is a spurious relationship or
patterns of CAM use in high SES groups contribute to better health.

## Fundamental Causes

In response to epidemiology's focus on proximate, individual-level risk
factors, @link1995 developed the theory of fundamental causes to draw
attention to social conditions as the root cause of health disparities.
Link and Phelan observe that the association between socioeconomic
status and health has persisted across changing historical contexts
involving extraordinary advancements in public health, advancements
which were fully expected to eradicate socioeconomic health disparities
(e.g. mass immunization and public sanitation improvements). Link and
Phelan that the association between SES and health endures because SES
is a fundamental cause of health. There are four defining features of a
fundamental social cause of health disparities. First, a fundamental
cause influences multiple disease outcomes. Second, a fundamental cause
affects health through a multiplicity of mechanisms. Third, fundamental
social causes involve access to flexible resources (e.g. knowledge,
money, power, prestige, and social connections) that can be leveraged
toward protective behaviors and environments that favor better health.
Fourth, the association between a fundamental social cause and health
endures over time because the intervening mechanisms by which it affects
health are replaced. As some diseases are eradicated, new ones take
their place. As risk factors, and therefore the mechanisms that had
produced the association between SES and health from the mid-20th
century, disappeared, new risk factors took their place. As risk factors
and mechanisms changed, individuals with higher SES were better situated
to leverage their resources (e.g. knowledge, money, power, prestige, and
social connections) toward protective behaviors and environments that
favor better health. Thus, the association between SES and health is not
attributable to any one set of mechanisms, but to the flexibility with
which socioeconomic resources may be employed in pursuit of better
health [@link2008; @lutfey2005].

The flexible resources associated with high SES operate at two levels:
individual and contextual. At the individual level, flexible resources
can be defined as the "cause of causes" or "risks of risk." At this
level flexible resources influence individuals' knowledge of, access to,
and social support for engaging in behaviors that promote or protect
health. At the contextual level, the resources associated with high SES
shape access to contexts that are characterized by health promoting
factors and low-risk profiles. For example, the economic resources
associated with high SES shape access to high SES neighborhoods with low
crime, low noise and environmental pollution, and more green spaces.
Education credentials associated with high SES shape access to desirable
and safe work environments. At the contextual level, high SES
individuals benefit passively from their social position, without
actively constructing a healthy situation. Research on epigenetics
[@landecker2013] and stressful life conditions [@house2000; @turner1995]
demonstrate how SES operates on a contextual level to promote health.
This dissertation focuses on how the flexible resources associated with
high SES operate on the individual level to reproduce health advantages
through health behaviors.

@freese2010 extend fundamental causes theory by explicating four
metamechanisms by which fundamental causes influence health. The first
metamechanism is "means," and refers to processes in which the
individual intentional leverages their socioeconomic resources to
enhance or protect health. The second mechanism, "spillovers," refers to
situations in which the individual benefits from the health promoting
efforts of others in their network without taking purposeful action of
their own. This metamechanism operates on the contextual level described
above. The third metamechanism, habitus, refers to internalized
dispositions to act produced through socialization processes. People of
the same social class tend to share habitus. The high SES habitus tends
to be more beneficial to health compared to other class habiti. The
habitus concept is explored in full in the following section. The
habitus metamechanism is similar to the means metamechanism in that
health is produced through the individual's behaviors, but in the case
of habitus actions are not consciously aimed toward health. Action flows
from class preferences unthinkingly. The fourth mechanism, institutions,
refers to the ways in which institutions contribute to SES health
disparities through differential treatment according to SES. For
example, variation in aspects of medical care and educational resources
offered to low and high SES patients [@lutfey2005].

In sum, fundamental causes theory asserts that SES is a fundamental
cause of health inequalities. High SES individuals have access to
flexible resources that operate through a multiplicity of mechanisms to
generate an SES health advantage across an array of heath outcomes. The
following theories elaborate on the relationship between SES and one of
those mechanisms, health behaviors.

## Health Lifestyle Theory

William Cockerham and colleagues [@cockerham1997; @cockerham2005;
@cockerham2007; @cockerham2013; @cockerham1993; @cockerham2002]
developed Health Lifestyle Theory by synthesizing, among other works,
Max Weber's Economy and Society [@weber1978] and Pierre Bourdieu'
Distinction [@bourdieu1984]. @cockerham1997[p. 321] defines health
lifestyles as "collective patterns of health-related behavior based on
choices from options available to people according to their life
chances." His precise theoretical model can be divided into two primary
components: structural influences and the habitus.

@weber1978's contribution to the structural component of health
lifestyle theory begins with his assertion that lifestyles are formed in
status groups. Status groups are aggregates of people with similar
status and class backgrounds whose association features a sharing of
similar lifestyles. Social statuses or structural locations within
systems of stratification direct our exposure to specific elements of
culture like health-related beliefs, norms, and customs through
socialization and experience. The idea is that people with common social
backgrounds will subscribe to the same elements of culture because they
tend to have similar socialization experiences. The most powerful
structural variable involved in this process is class circumstances,
along with age, race, gender, and the influence of collectivities (e.g.,
family, work, and religion) and living conditions. Common socialization
experiences and common elements of culture within the context of these
structural variables (what Bourdieu calls "fields") eventually shape our
life choices (agency). At the same time, our social positions also drive
our life chances (structure) by regulating our access to resources
through basic social stratification processes. People have lifestyle
choices, but those choices are constrained by what is available to them
given their social position. The final feature of the structural
component is the dialectical interplay of agency (choices) and structure
(chances). @cockerham2005 [p. 61] explains that people "align their
goals, needs, and desires with their probabilities for realizing them
and choose a lifestyle according to their assessments of the reality of
their resources and class circumstances."

The repetitive interplay of choices (agency) and chances (structure)
through socialization and experience leads to the development of habitus
or internalized dispositions toward behavior or action. The modern
concept of the habitus was refined by @bourdieu1984 and represents
perhaps his most lasting contribution to sociological theory. According
to @cockerham2005 [p. 61], "the habitus serves as a cognitive map or set
of perceptions that routinely guides and evaluates a person's choices
and options. It provides enduring dispositions toward acting deemed
appropriate by a person in particular social situations and settings."
Once the habitus is formed, health-related practices like smoking,
exercise, and dietary behavior become "integrated into routine
behavioral repertories that can be acted out more or less unthinkingly"
[@cockerham2005, p. 62]. The final element of the habitus component is
the reproduction of health lifestyles through feedback processes. When
health lifestyles are formed and enacted, "they tend to reproduce or
modify the habitus from which they are derived" [@cockerham2005, p.63].
In other words, when we carry out our lifestyles, we either reinforce or
alter our dispositions and practices.

Health lifestyle theory proposes health lifestyles as a mechanism by
which SES shapes health inequalities. Due to its effect on life chances,
life choices, and, in turn, the habitus, high SES produces similar
health promoting lifestyles among its members. This dissertation
examines whether SES similarly influences the formation of alternative
health lifestyles consisting of CAMs, and whether an alternative health
lifestyle contributes to the SES-health relationship.

## Human Capital Theory

John Mirowsky and Catherine Ross [@mirowsky1998; @mirowsky2003]
developed their Human Capital Theory by synthesizing the works of
@becker1964 in economics and @rotter1966 in psychology. In contrast to
Cockerham's General Theory (which can be applied to any system of
stratification), Mirowsky and Ross' theory is focused exclusively on
explaining how healthy lifestyles flow from years of formal education.
Mirowsky and Ross' theoretical model can be divided into two primary
components: the human capital component and the learned-effectiveness
component.

The first component, drawing primarily from @becker1964, argues that
"formal education indicates investment in 'human capital' - the
productive capacity developed, embodied, and stocked in human beings
themselves" [@mirowsky2003, p. 51]. The idea is relatively
straightforward: The process of formal education nurtures knowledge,
skills, and abilities that help people to solve problems and to be
productive in their own lives. Some of the more important elements of
education include health-related knowledge and skills associated with
reading, writing, researching, critical thinking, and communicating.

The second component, drawing primarily from @rotter1966, argues that
formal educational attainment, human capital investment, and the
development of skills and abilities tends to foster a healthy lifestyle
by promoting a general sense of learned-effectiveness or personal
control over one's life. According to @mirowsky2003 [p. 64], "education
raises the sense of personal control because it helps people
successfully prevent problems, or solve them if prevention fails, to
achieve their goals, and shape their own lives." Through years of formal
education, skill development, and structured problem solving, people
learn that they can organize their lives, achieve goals, and actively
manage the good and bad things that happen to them. The sense of control
then contributes to a healthy lifestyle by cultivating a proactive or
agentic orientation toward one's health. @mirowsky2003 [p. 66] explain
that "people with a sense of personal control know more about health,
they are more likely to initiate preventive behaviors like quitting
smoking, exercising, or maintaining a normal weight."

## Health Commodity Theory

The Health Commodity Theory was initially described by @ross2000 in the
context of explaining the link between socioeconomic status (SES) and
health. A commodity is something of value that can be bought and sold.
Health commodity theory argues that SES promotes health through
purchasing power. Similar to fundamental social causes theory
[@link2010], health commodity theory is structural and materialistic.
That is, health commodity theory tends to reduce the complex association
between SES and health to mechanisms linked to financial resources or
things people can buy like health care, pharmaceuticals, and healthier
foods. Ultimately, the defining question is "who gets what?"

Health Lifestyle Theory and Human Capital Theory take the same general
form. Both theories argue that social structure shapes and clusters
health related behavior through social psychological processes. While
Cockerham emphasizes the mechanisms of socialization and habitus
(internalized behavior norms), Mirowsky and Ross stress the development
of human capital (skills and abilities) and the sense of personal
control (beliefs about one's personal effectiveness). Health commodity
theory competes with these social psychological theories by emphasizing
a direct link between social structure and health-related behavior.
Although health lifestyle theory and human capital theory acknowledge
the role of resource stratification in explaining broader structural
disparities in health lifestyles, they also recognize more elaborate
downstream social psychological processes. If the predictions of health
commodity theory are correct, income should partially mediate or explain
educational variations in health lifestyles. Under these conditions, the
effects of education on health-related behavior would be partially due
to the fact that people with higher levels of education tend to earn
more money. This fact would minimize (not eliminate) the explanatory
power of processes related to socialization and habitus, human capital,
and the sense of personal control.

# Data

For this dissertation, I utilize data from all three waves of the
Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study, a national longitudinal
study of health and well-being. The first wave of MIDUS was collected in
1995-1996 by the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Successful
Midlife Development. The purpose of the study was to examine the role of
behavioral, psychological, and social factors in producing health and
well-being across age groups. Respondents at all three waves completed
telephone and mail in questionnaires which comprise the survey project.
This dissertation uses the survey projects, which are currently
available across all three waves. Data collection for MIDUS I began with
a national random digit dialing sample (RDD) (n=3,487). Households were
randomly selected from working telephone banks. One household member
between the ages of 25 and 74 was selected for participation. MIDUS I
was expanded to also include an oversample of five metropolitan areas
(n=757), siblings of individuals from the RDD sample (n=950), and a
national RDD sample of twin pairs (n=1,914). Respondents were asked to
complete a telephone survey and two mail-in self-administered
questionnaires (SAQs). Response rates for the telephone survey ranged
from 60-70% across subsamples (n=7,108). Response rates for the SAQs
averaged 89% (n=6,329).

In 2004-2006, the Institute on Aging at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison conducted MIDUS II, a follow-up on MIDUS I
respondents, with funding from the National Institute on Aging. Of the
7,108 participants in MIDUS I, 75% completed the telephone survey for
MIDUS II (n=4963), adjusted for mortality. Of those that completed the
telephone survey, 81% completed the two SAQs (n=4032). Completion time
between MIDUS I and MIDUS II ranged from 7.8 to 10.4 years.

Data collection for MIDUS III began in 2013. Survey project (telephone
and mail in questionnaires) data collection ended in 2014, however, data
collection for other projects within this wave continues today. Of the
4,963 MIDUS II participants contacted, 66% were eligible for
participation at MIDUS III and completed the telephone survey (n=3,294).
Of those that completed the telephone survey, 83% completed the SAQs at
MIDUS III (n=2,732). Completion time between MIDUS II and MIDUS III
ranged from 7.9 to 10.3 years.

# Contributions

This dissertation...

This dissertation will advance the literature on health lifestyles in
several ways. First, to this point in time, studies on health lifestyles
have not included CAMs, which are utilized by a substantial portion of
the US population. Second, most studies on CAM use have utilized
cross-sectional or trend data. This study will utilize longitudinal data
across three time points. This will allow me to examine when CAM use
changes for individuals over time, how CAM use changes, and for whom
those changes occur with respect to health. Additionally, this
longitudinal design will allow me to establish health lifestyles as a
mechanism for the relationship between SES and health.
